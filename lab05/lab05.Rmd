## 1. Read in the data
```{r read-data, cache=TRUE}
if (!file.exists("../lab03/met_all.gz")) {
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/master/02_met/met_all.gz", "met_all.gz", method="libcurl", timeout = 60) 
}
met <- data.table::fread("../lab03/met_all.gz") 
```

Remove temperatures less than -17C and Make sure there are no missing data in the key variables coded as 9999, 999, etc
```{r remove-low-temp}
met <- met[temp> -17] [elev == 9999.0, elev := NA]
```

Read in the stations data:
```{r stations, cache=TRUE}
# Download the data
stations <- fread("ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-history.csv")
stations[, USAF := as.integer(USAF)]

# Dealing with NAs and 999999
stations[, USAF   := fifelse(USAF == 999999, NA_integer_, USAF)]
stations[, CTRY   := fifelse(CTRY == "", NA_character_, CTRY)]
stations[, STATE  := fifelse(STATE == "", NA_character_, STATE)]

# Selecting the three relevant columns, and keeping unique records
stations <- unique(stations[, list(USAF, CTRY, STATE)])

# Dropping NAs
stations <- stations[!is.na(USAF)]  

# Removing duplicates
stations[, n := 1:.N, by = .(USAF)]
stations <- stations[n == 1,][, n := NULL]
```

merge met data with stations. 
```{r merge datatables}
met <-
merge(
  # Data
  x     = met,      
  y     = stations, 
  # List of variables to match
  by.x  = "USAFID",
  by.y  = "USAF", 
  # Which obs to keep?
  all.x = TRUE,      
  all.y = FALSE
  ) 

nrow(met)
```

##Question 1: Representative station for the US

Compute mean temperature, wind speed and atmospheric pressure for each weather station, and pick the weather station with the average value closest to the median for the US. 

```{r}
station_averages <-
  met[ , .(
    temp = mean (temp, na.rm=T),
    wind.sp = mean(wind.sp, na.rm=T),
    atm.press = mean(atm.press, na.rm=T)
  ), by = USAFID]
```

The above computes the mean by weather station.
Now let's compute the median value for each variable.


```{r}
stmeds <- station_averages[ , .(
          temp50     = median(temp, na.rm=T),
          windsp50   = median(wind.sp, na.rm=T),
          atmpress50 = median(atm.press,na.rm=T)
)]
stmeds
```
A helpful function we might want to use 'which.min()"


```{r}
station_averages [ , 
                   temp_dist50 := abs(temp - stmeds$temp50)][order(temp_dist50)]
```

Let's use which.min
```{r}
station_averages[ which.min(temp_dist50)]
```


It matches the result above. 

```{r}
station_averages [ , 
                   wind.sp_dist50 := abs(wind.sp - stmeds$wind.sp50)][order(wind.sp_dist50)]
```

```{r}
station_averages [ , 
                   atmpress_dist50 := abs(atm.press - stmeds$atmpress50)][order(atmpress_dist50)]
```
## Question 2: Representative station per state
Just like the previous question, you are asked to identify what is the most representative, the median, station per state. This time, instead of looking at one variable at a time, look at the euclidean distance. If multiple stations show in the median, select the one located at the lowest latitude.


```{r}
station_averages <- 
     met[ , .(
       temp      = mean(temp, na.rm=T),
       wind.sp   = mean(wind.sp, na.rm=T),
       atm.press = mean(atm.press,na.rm=T)
     ), by = .(USAFID,STATE)]
head(station_averages)
```
```{r}
statemeds <- station_averages[ , .(
          temp50     = median(temp, na.rm=T),
          windsp50   = median(wind.sp, na.rm=T)
          ), by = STATE]
statemeds
```

```{r}
station_averages <- 
  merge(
  x = station_averages,
  y = statemeds,
  by.x = "STATE",
  by.y = "STATE",
  all.x = TRUE,
  all.y = FALSE
)
```


```{r}
station_averages[ , temp_dist_state50 := temp - temp50]
station_averages[ , windsp_dist_state50 := wind.sp - windsp50]
station_averages
```
```{r}
station_averages [, eucdist := temp_dist_state50^2 +
                                windsp_dist_state50^2]
```

```{r}
repstation <- station_averages [, .(
                  eucdist = min(eucdist, na.rm=T))
                  , by=STATE]
                  
```
Now I’ll find the station with the lowest Euclidean distance to the median temperature and wind speed by merging these minimum distances back with the station names, and only saving the records that include the minimum Euclidean distance.


```{r}
repweather <- 
  merge(
  x = station_averages,
  y = repstation,
  by.x = c("eucdist","STATE"),
  by.y = c("eucdist","STATE"),
  all.x = FALSE,
  all.y = TRUE
)
repweather
```
Phew! We found the stations with temperture and wind speed closest in Euclidean distance to the median temp and median wind speed in the state.

##Question 3: in the middle?

For each state, identify what is the station that is closest to the mid-point of the state. Combining these with the stations you identified in the previous question, use leaflet() to visualize all ~100 points in the same figure, applying different colors for those identified in this question.
Get station locations:

```{r}
met_stations <- unique(met[, .(USAFID, STATE, lon, lat)])
nrow(met_stations)
```

```{r}
length(unique(met$USAFID))
```

I have more station locations than I have stations. Some stations must have been moved at some point. I will pick the locations from the earliest recording in the month.

```{r}
met_stations <- unique(met[order(USAFID,day,hour)][, .(USAFID, STATE, lon, lat)])
met_stations[, n := 1:.N, by=USAFID]
met_stations <- met_stations[n == 1][, n:= NULL]
nrow(met_stations)
```
Now let’s find the central location of these weather stations by state. To do this we compute the distance from each station to the central location, and grab the station with the smallest distance.

```{r}
met_stations[, lat_mid := quantile(lat, probs = .5, na.rm = TRUE), by=STATE]
met_stations[, lon_mid := quantile(lon, probs = .5, na.rm = TRUE), by=STATE]
# Looking at the euclidean distances
met_stations[, dist := sqrt((lat-lat_mid)^2+(lon-lon_mid)^2)]
met_stations[, mindist := which.min(dist), by=STATE]
```

Now let’s create an index for each station by state, so we can pick the record that yielded the minimum distance.
```{r}
met_stations[, n := 1:.N, by=STATE]
met_stations[order(STATE,dist)]
```
Notice how min.dist == n for the station with the shortest distance in AL. We’ll select these for each state, and just save the station id, state and location information.
```{r}
met_location <- met_stations[n == mindist, .(USAFID, STATE, lon, lat)][order(STATE)]
met_location
```
Notice how there are only 48 states selected. Using which.min will select the first occurrence, and therefore does not return multiple records per state if there are ties.

Let’s add these to the stations from the previous question and plot their locations on a map of the US. I’ll use ggplot() this time for a static plot, instead of a dynamic plot in leaflet().

First, get the locations for the stations from Q2.

```{r}
repweather <-
  merge(
  x =   repweather[, .(USAFID, STATE)],
  y = met_stations[, .(USAFID, STATE, lat, lon)],
  by.x = c("USAFID","STATE"),
  by.y = c("USAFID","STATE"),
  all.x = TRUE,
  all.y = FALSE
) 

repweather[, station_type := "met"]
met_location <- met_location[, .(USAFID, STATE, lat, lon)][, station_type := "loc"]
all_stations <- rbind(repweather, met_location, use.names=TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Visualizing the data
ggplot(map_data("state"), aes(x = long, y = lat)) +
  geom_map(aes(map_id = region), map = map_data("state"), col = "lightgrey", fill = "gray") +
  geom_point(
    data    = all_stations,
    mapping = aes(x = lon, y = lat, col = station_type),
    inherit.aes = FALSE, cex = 2, alpha = 0.5
    )
```

The orange dots show the weather stations most central to all locations in the state, and the aqua dots show those with weather that's most repesentative of the weather in the state. Most states have 2 dots. In Florida, Kentucky, and West Virginia there is only 1 dot, and the color appears to be a combination of the 2 colors in the legend, meaning it’s the same weather station that is centrally located and reporting the average weather for the state.

##Question 4: means of means

Using the quantile() function, generate a summary table that shows the number of states included, average temperature, wind-speed, and atmospheric pressure by the variable “average temperature level,” which you’ll need to create.

Start by computing the states’ average temperature. Use that measurement to classify them according to the following criteria:

low: temp < 20 Mid: temp >= 20 and temp < 25 High: temp >= 25


```{r}
met[, state_temp := mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), by = STATE]
met[, temp_cat := fifelse(
  state_temp < 20, "low-temp", 
  fifelse(state_temp < 25, "mid-temp", "high-temp"))
  ]
head(met)
```
```{r}
table(met$temp_cat, useNA = "always")
```

```{r summarize}
tab <- met[, .(
  N_entries   = .N,
  N_stations  = length(unique(USAFID)),
  N_states    = length(unique(STATE)),
  avg_temp    = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE),
  avg_wind.sp = mean(wind.sp, na.rm = TRUE),
  avg_atm.pre = mean(atm.press, na.rm = TRUE)
), by = temp_cat]

knitr::kable(tab)
```
