# Question 1. How many papers are on Sars-cov-2?

```{r}
# Downloading the website
website <- xml2::read_html("https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=sars-cov-2")
# Finding the counts
counts <- xml2::xml_find_first(website, "/html/body/main/div[9]/div[2]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]")
# Turning it into text
counts <- as.character(counts)
# Extracting the data using regex
stringr::str_extract(counts, "[0-9,]+")
```

## Question 2: Academic publications on COVID19 and Hawaii

You need to query the following The parameters passed to the query are documented here.

Use the function httr::GET() to make the following query:

Baseline URL: https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi

Query parameters:

db: pubmed
term: covid19 hawaii
retmax: 1000


```{r}
library(httr)
query_ids <- GET(
  url   = "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi",
  query = list(
    db      = "pubmed",
    term    = "covid19 hawaii",
    retmax  = 1000
  ), 
)
# Extracting the content of the response of GET
ids <- httr::content(query_ids)
```

## Question 3: Get details about the articles
The Ids are wrapped around text in the following way: <Id>... id number ...</Id>. we can use a regular expression that extract that information. Fill out the following lines of code:

```{r}
# Turn the result into a character vector
ids <- as.character(ids)

# Find all the ids 
ids <- stringr::str_extract_all(ids, "PATTERN")[[1]]

# Remove all the leading and trailing <Id> </Id>. Make use of "|"
ids <- stringr::str_remove_all(ids, "PATTERN")
```

Grab publications with these Pubmed IDs.

```{r}
publications <- GET(
  url   = "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi",
  query = list(
    db  = "pubmed",
    id  = paste(ids,collapse = ","),
  retmax = 1000,
  rettype = "abstract"
    )
)
# Extracting the content of the response of GET
publications <- httr::content(publications)
```
