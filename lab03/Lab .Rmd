```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


## Step 1 Read in the data
First download and then read in with data.table:fread()
```{r}
if (!file.exists("met_all.gz")) {
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/master/02_met/met_all.gz", "met_all.gz", method="libcurl", timeout = 60) 
}
met <- data.table::fread("met_all.gz") 
```

##Step 2 Check the dimensions, headers, footers. How many columns, rows are there?
```{r}
dim(met)
## [1] 2377343      30
head(met)
tail(met)
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
