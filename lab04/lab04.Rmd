```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r install-libraries}
library(lubridate)
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
```

## Step 1 Read in the data
First download and then read in with data.table:fread()
```{r read-data, cache=TRUE}
if (!file.exists("met_all.gz")) {
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/master/02_met/met_all.gz", "met_all.gz", method="libcurl", timeout = 60) 
}
met <- data.table::fread("met_all.gz") 
```

##Step 2 Prepare the Data 

Remove temperatures less than -17C and Make sure there are no missing data in the key variables coded as 9999, 999, etc
```{r remove-low-temp}
met <- met[temp> -17] [elev == 9999.0, elev := NA]
```

# check no 9999s in other important variables 

Generate a date variable using the functions as.Date() (hint: You will need the following to create a date paste(year, month, day, sep = "-")).
```{r create-ymd, cache=TRUE}
met <- met[ , ymd:= as.Date(paste(year, month, day, sep = "-"))]
```


Using the data.table::week function, keep the observations of the first week of the month.
```{r}
met[, table(week(ymd))]
met <- met[week(ymd)==31]
```

Compute the mean by station of the variables temp, rh, wind.sp, vis.dist, dew.point, lat, lon, and elev.

```{r}
met_avg <- met [, .(
  temp = max(temp,na.rm=T),
  rh = max(rh,na.rm=T),
  wind.sp = max(wind.sp,na.rm=T),
  vis.dist = max(vis.dist,na.rm=T),
  dew.point = max(dew.point,na.rm=T),
  lat = max(lat,na.rm=T),
  lon = max(lon,na.rm=T),
  elev = max(elev,na.rm=T)
)]
```
Great! No more 9999s in our dataset.

```{r check-avg}
met_avg <- met [, .(
  temp = mean(temp,na.rm=T),
  rh = mean(rh,na.rm=T),
  wind.sp = mean(wind.sp,na.rm=T),
  vis.dist = mean(vis.dist,na.rm=T),
  dew.point = mean(dew.point,na.rm=T),
  lat = mean(lat,na.rm=T),
  lon = mean(lon,na.rm=T),
  elev = mean(elev,na.rm=T)
), by = 'USAFID'] 
```

Create a region variable for NW, SW, NE, SE based on lon = -98.00 and lat = 39.71 degrees

```{r}
met_avg <- met[, region := fifelse(lon >= -98 & lat > 39.71, "NE", 
                fifelse(lon < -98 & lat > 39.71, "NW",
                fifelse(lon < -98 & lat <= 39.71, "SW","SE") ))]
table(met_avg$region)
```

Create a categorical variable for elevation as in the lecture slides
```{r}
met_avg [, elev_cat := fifelse(elev > 252, "high", "low")]
```

## step 3 make violin plots of dew point temp by region
```{r}
met_avg[!is.na(region)] %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = 1, y = dew.point, fill=region)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ region, nrow = 1)
```
The highest dew point temperatures are reported in the southeast

```{r}
met_avg[!is.na(region) & !is.na(wind.sp)] %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = 1, y = wind.sp, fill=region)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ region, nrow = 1)
```

## 4. Use geom_jitter with stat_smooth to examine the association between dew point temperature and wind speed by region
Colour points by region
Make sure to deal with NA category
Fit a linear regression line by region
Describe what you observe in the graph

```{r scatterplot-dewpoint-wind.sp}
met_avg[!is.na(region) & !is.na(wind.sp)] %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=wind.sp, y = dew.point)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = region)) + 
geom_smooth(mapping = aes(linetype = region), )
```
